    <p>It rests in the corner. <br><br>Small, dark, and...ancient? <br><br>😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰</p>

    It's ... a cockroach! <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Roaches">What shall we do?</a><br><br>
    🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<br><br>
    I grab a slipper.<br><br>
    My roommate arms herself with Raid.<br><br>
    We approach like warriors<br><br>
    With fear in our throats<br><br>
    And laughter trembling under it.

    Screams. Chaos. <br><br>
    A slipper thrown like a spell. <br><br>
    It's over. <br><br>
    We are heroes. <br><br>
    We are grossed out. <br><br>
    😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠</p> 
    <p>
    The room falls quiet again. <br><br>
    Only the echo of laughter and insect spray lingers. <br><br>
    We laugh. <br> <br>
    And then disinfect everything.
