<pre>We met at a hot pot restaurant in Richmond â€” a meal that felt like such a luxury back then.
We talked for a long time, as if the years of distance between us had never existed.
I still remember that before he left, I took him to a local Chinese supermarket, and he carried home several large bags of groceries.</pre>

<pre>In my memory of that afternoon, the Vancouver sunlight was warm and gentle.
Standing against the light, I watched as he slowly disappeared into the entrance of the SkyTrain.
Along with his fading silhouette went the last trace of my very first heartbeat.</pre>
<br>
<pre>That was the last time I saw him.
Even though we had moved to the same city, at that point I didnâ€™t have the strength to take care of much else.
I eventually returned to China and, little by little, let go of the other shore of my life.
Years later, at a reunion he couldnâ€™t attend, a mutual friend casually mentioned that he had known I liked him back then â€” those hundred paper stars, filled with quiet feelings, had inevitably given me away.
After that gathering, on a whim, I sent him a long message, thanking him for never exposing the clumsy tenderness of my youth.
I donâ€™t dare think too hard about what kind of fate once let our paths run so close on such a vast planet, or whether we might have missed something along the way.
Perhaps the truth is that we missed nothing at all â€” just like the wager we never spoke of again.</pre>

<pre>After that final exchange, we both grew into the adults we had hoped to become.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre>He went on to study physics in the U.K.; I studied film in New York.</pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre>We each built lives that are full and bright./pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre>And those hundred little stars will always shine quietly in some hidden corner of my heart.</pre>
