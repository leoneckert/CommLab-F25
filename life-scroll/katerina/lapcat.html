  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Lap Cat was one of my favorites of the day and one of the cats I wanted to take home :( This cat was always sitting in someone's lap. The small orange tabby shimmied itself between my legs and refused to leave. This cat was extremely affectionate and loved naps and tiny spaces. It was also extremely beautiful with amber eyes that matched its beautiful orange fur! </p>
