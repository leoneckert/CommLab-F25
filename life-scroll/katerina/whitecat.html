  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>White cat was huge compared to most of the others, and also had a large personality. Every time a toy was brought out, it was very energetic. It was kind of aggressive with the toys but in a non-intimidating way. Outside of play, White Cat preferred lounging and seemed a little lazy but it really liked my shoes. Although it did not seemed to fond of Black Cat, the two were found hanging around each other the entire duration of my visit. I enjoyed this cat's silly attitude but unfortunately did not get to pet it much. </p>
