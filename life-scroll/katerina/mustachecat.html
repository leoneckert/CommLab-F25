  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Mustache Cat had a very interesting visual appeal: it had a mustache! I did not notice this cat at first because its presence was very mild but I was very entertained by its mysterious vibe. This piebald cat was generally very chill and not overly affectionate. It was extremely calm and quite elegent. I think this cat would pair extremely well with a tuxedo cat to complete the "gentlemanly" vibe.</p>
