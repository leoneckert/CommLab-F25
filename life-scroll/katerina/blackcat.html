  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Black Cat made an impression right away! This cat was extremely popular with all of the visitors for its striking appearance. One of my friends commented that it looked like Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon! This cat stood out to me particularly for its hot and cold attitude. It will pace around in circles without approaching people but come when other cats get attention. It is also extremely vocal. Black Cat would also approach White Cat very often. Despite the seeming indifference from White Cat, they were a very cute black and white duo. </p>
