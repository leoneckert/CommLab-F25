  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>One of my favorites of the day! This cat was extremely affectionate and loved getting cheek pets. It was also obsessed with making biscuits on my jeans, which was a little painful. This cat hung around me for quite some time so I grew very fond of it. If I could, I would take this cat home :( Definitely one of my favorites of the day! </p>
